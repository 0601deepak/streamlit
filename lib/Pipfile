# NOTE: We only use this Pipfile to manage dev and test dependencies.
# Dependencies for releases of the Streamlit library itself should be added in
# setup.py. See https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/advanced/#pipfile-vs-setup-py
# for more information on why things are done in this way.

# This file exists only so that developers can use previously created

# Dependencies are defined in lib/*-requirements*.txt files.
# We recommend using python -m venv to manage your virtual environment.
# To install the dependencies, use the Makefile script.
