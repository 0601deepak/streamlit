# Frontend
This is the frontend code for streamlit. It's split into two packages:

1. `app`
 - This contains the app level code that utilizes the lib package.
 - This app package is bundled and packaged by mainly CRA (create react app) even though we are ejected from CRA. This is to maintain backwards compatibility with yarn start and yarn build within the app directory. In addition, CRA is losing support.
 - With the ejection of CRA, there are configs that are shown because of the ejection that exist in the config directory. They're mainly just regular javascript files that represent config files.
 - In the `package.json`, we list `@streamlit/lib` as a dependency where the versioning and name comes from the `package.json` from `lib`.
2. `lib`
 - This contains the Streamlit components for frontend/app or other apps to consume.
 - This library is bundled though a custom [babel](https://babeljs.io/) profile and [tsc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html).
 - we also emit the autogenerated protobuf types and our assets.

We use yarn workspaces in order to deal with dependency management so most node_modules are still in the frontend directory but some of them exist within app and lib. Yarn workspaces also allows us to list `@streamlit/lib` as a dependency in the `app` directory.

In addition, we have jest configs for app and lib. These were originally handled by CRA but we now manage them ourselves with `jest.config.js`.
